## KiloSort processor plugin to MountainLab

This project wraps the spike sorting algorithm, [KiloSort](https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort), as a processor plugin of [MountainLab](https://github.com/magland/mountainlab).

Right now the processor executes in CPU-only mode. But, as KiloSort is designed to run using GPU, this capabilities will be incremented soon.

This plugin is at a very early stage and is under prelim development. More info coming soon.
